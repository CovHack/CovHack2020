# What is a hackathon?  
A hackathon is a 24-hour event where teams and individuals create a project from scratch within the given time frame. Software programmers, developers, designers, and anyone with a passion for creating things come together to produce fun, interesting, and sometimes downright silly projects.


What kind of project can I work on?  
You can work on anything you want to! As long as your project does not break the MLH Code of Conduct (which can be found [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)), you can make it!
