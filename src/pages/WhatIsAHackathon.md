# What is a hackathon?

A hackathon is a 24-hour event where teams and individuals create a project from scratch within the given time frame. Software programmers, developers, designers, and anyone with a passion for creating things come together to produce fun, interesting, and sometimes downright silly projects.  

What kind of project can I work on?  
You can work on anything you want to! As long as your project does not break the MLH Code of Conduct (which can be found [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)), you can make it!  

Why should I attend?  

1.  Free food
2.  Free swag
3.  Meet new people
4.  Learn cool things
5.  Make cool things!

So...what are you waiting for?
