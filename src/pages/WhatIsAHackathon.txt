<h1>What is a hackathon?</h1> </br>
A hackathon is a 24-hour event where teams and individuals create a project from scratch within the given time frame. Software programmers, developers, designers, and anyone with a passion for creating things come together to produce fun, interesting, and sometimes downright silly projects. </br>
</br>
What kind of project can I work on?</br>
You can work on anything you want to! As long as your project does not break the MLH Code of Conduct (which can be found <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">here</a>), you can make it!</br>
</br>
Why should I attend?</br>

  <li>Meet new people</li>
  <li>Learn cool things</li>
  <li>Make cool things!</li>
</ol>

So...what are you waiting for?
