# Coventry Hacktoberfest 2019

[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) is an event run by DigitalOcean and DEV.to to encourage contributions to open source projects during October. If you open 4 pull requests during October you can get a _free Hacktoberfest t-shirt_!

We'll be hosting a space on __Wednesday 23rd October__ from __1pm-6pm in [CW217](https://goo.gl/maps/QsSjQKYbWuWYDE1q9)__ where students can work on their open source contributions. __Don't forget to bring your laptop!__

We'll also run a workshop on how to contribute to open source on GitHub for first-time open sourcers. Feel free to come for the full 5 hours, or just drop in for a while.

If you've not come along to one of our meetings before, this is a great chance to get to know the HackSoc team!
