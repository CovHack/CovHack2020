### CovHack is a free 24hr student hackathon, organised by Coventry Universityâ€™s Hackathon Society

Students from any university, no matter your skill set, are invited to build weird, wacky, and wonderful projects.

If you need a break from your project, we will have workshops and side events lined up throughout the weekend.
We want you to get the most out of your time at CovHack, so make sure to check these side events out!
