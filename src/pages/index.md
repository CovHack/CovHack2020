## Welcome to CovHack2020!

CovHack 2020 is a student hackathon organised by the Hackathon Society at Coventry University.

Students from Coventry and beyond of all skill levels are invited to come and build weird, wacky and wonderful projects.

We will be running various side events during the event, including software workshops, code golfs and a CTF security challenge!
